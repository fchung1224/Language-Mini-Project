"1","Another Terrorist Attack in NYCWhy Are we STILL Being Politically Correct  Eagle Rising","On Saturday September 17 at 830 pm EST an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea injuring 29 people smashing windows and initiating street closures There were no fatalities Officials maintain that a homemade bomb which had been placed in a dumpster created the explosion The explosive device was removed by the police at 225 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico Virginia for analysis A second device which has been described as a pressure cooker device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue By Sunday morning all 29 people had been released from the hospital The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race There were no casualties By Sunday afternoon law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same personGiven that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent when a bomb goes off our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism After all in the last year alone we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris San Bernardino California Orlando Florida and Nice to name a few And of course last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11 2001 attacks where close to 3000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists However we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards selfpreservation which of course includes identifying the evildoers Isnt that how crimes are solved Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the bad guys Unfortunately our leadership  who ostensibly wants to protect us  finds their hands and their tongues tied They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyoneNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio  who famously ended stopandfrisk profiling in his city  was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and  agencies are at full alert he said Isnt an intentional act terrorism We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals It is still terrorism It is not an accident James ONeill the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments New Yorks Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility However he did say that it is a question of how the word terrorism is defined A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism Cuomo hit the nail on the head but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his obvious assessmentThe two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion Clinton was very generic in her response saying that we need to do everything we can to support our first responders  also to pray for the victims and that we need to let this investigation unfold Trump was more direct I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows whats going on he said But boy we are living in a timewe better get very tough folks We better get very very tough Its a terrible thing thats going on in our world in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilantUnfortunately an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as soft targets Now more than ever America needs strong leadership which is laserfocused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres

"4","Trump vs Clinton A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works","Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs Clinton A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zerosum She believes all boats rise together Hillary is right but a lot of people are buying into Trumps visionAs he made clear once again in Monday nights debate Donald Trump sees the world in zerosum termswhen one person or one country wins another always loses Asked by NBCs Lester Holt how to help American workers Trump responded in his usual way saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world and the NAFTA freetrade deal was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry  We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobsHillary Clinton by contrast sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at onceas she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clintons proglobalization presidency which included NAFTA I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again she said Incomes went up for everybodyStory Continued BelowThat is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence My whole life is about winning  I always win Trump says in explaining why hes running The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric Winning the Global Competition You dont get more zerosum than thatDespite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zerosum gamebut rather a complex mechanism that if run right can raise everyones welfare at onceTrumps message has resonated in an era when its become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy The zerosum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to growThe recent Census Report that showed a 52 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed Statistically if the United States is one unit that is true But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences illsuited to one size fit all numbers and while the averages and medians may go up or down that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative insecure and economically grimHence you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats while those who think theyve lost are going toward Trump There is some truth there but that isnt a sufficient explanation for why for instance massive percentages of AfricanAmericans and Latinos who have certainly struggled economically and socially support ClintonNo what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zerosum terms like Trump and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of winners without creating a commensurate number of losers That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagans appeal The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthierHillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity with millions working hard and succeeding President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley the revival of many cities in the past decade and the substantial gains on the other side of 20082009 financial crisis Judging from polls and surveys those who fit that description  clustered and concentrated in large metro areas and on the coasts especially  support Clinton and the Democrats by wide marginsIs either side right Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billionstrong global middle class In general that view is correct But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes be unable to afford healthcare that they will see their communities crumble and their childrens hopes extinguished And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better who seem to be winning and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothingThe voice of the socalled losers in this global competition is as loud politically speaking as its been in a long time Hence Trump not to mention Bernie Sanders powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning the few and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can In 1896 the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a cross of gold Bryan lost two elections and his zerosum view never came to dominate American politics Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system however was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats Some of it harsh and redistributive focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad and much of it was about expanding opportunities for allTrump also enjoys a good deal of subrosa support among business leaders and Wall Street who certainly havent lack for economic benefits in todays world They arent supporting him with their money but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view For Wall Street that makes some sense in that in the wake of the financial crisis key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable In that sense finance which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid1980s through the mid2000s has been losing ground The idea of gain and loss and that every trade represents a winner and a loser is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall StreetWe have of course no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks But if Trump wins he should remember it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zerosum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security Zerosum most often begets zerosum whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars By contrast the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zerosum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers and little

"6","10 Moments That Mattered From Hillary Clinton and Donald Trumps First Debate","Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight and they did it with plenty of barbsThe two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island New York in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewersHere are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate1 Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the SarcasmHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note although the mutual contempt was just below the surfaceWhen Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie  the opponents trading traditional party colors  the two shook hands and Clinton said How are you Donald Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greetingShortly after the debate began Trump talked about overseas trade deals saying But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying Yes is that OK Good I want you to be very happy Its very important to meHe seemed to be referring to his addressing her as Secretary Clinton although it wasnt completely clear during the moment2 Personal Attacks Came EarlyClinton was first to go on the attack during tonights debate taking aim at Trumps business roots by claiming he borrowed 14 million from his father to start his real estate businessDonald was very fortunate in his life and thats all to his benefit He started his business with 14 million borrowed from his father and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off well be and that everything will work out from there I dont buy that I have a different experience Clinton said before expanding on her fathers work as a drapery makerTrump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in trumped up trickledown economicsFor one thing and before we start on that my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company thats worth many many billions of dollars Trump said3 Trading Barbs Over TradeVoters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the TransPacific Partnership trade dealTrump accused Clinton of supporting TPP the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific RimAnd now you want to approve TransPacific Partnership You were totally in favor of it Trump saidClinton fired back Well that is just not accurate I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid outTrump then pointed to Clintons once referring to TPP as the gold standard of trade dealsWell Donald I know you live in your own reality but that is not the facts Clinton saidClinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama who is pushing the trade deal While speaking in Australia in November 15 2012 Clinton said TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year saying that what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it4 Trump Asks Why Not Blame All the Worlds Problems on ClintonLess than 30 minutes into the debate Trump went after Clinton attacking her on trade ISIS taxes the economy and more Clinton quipped I have a feeling by the end of this evening Im going to be blamed for everything thats ever happenedTrump didnt miss a beat saying to his opponent Why notClinton responded Why not Yeah Why not Just join the debate by saying more crazy things Now let me say thisTrump interjected Theres nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country before the moderator reminded Trump This is secretary Clintons two minutes pleaseDrew Angerer/Getty Images5 Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax ReturnsTrump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returnsI dont mind releasing Im under a routine audit and it will be released he said Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the US Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster generalTrump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server I will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishes when she releases her 33000 emails that have been deleted he saidI think youve just seen another example of bait and switch here For 40 years everyone running for president has release their tax returns she said You got to ask yourself Why wont he release his tax returnsMaybe he doesnt want the American people all of you watching tonight to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes she said6 The Birther Issue Gets on the Main StageModerator Lester Holt asked Trump what took you so long to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States bringing the Republican nominees recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for yearsAt first Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obamas birth certificate during the 2008 campaign  a claim that he has made before  and then said that he was satisfied with when Obama released his birth certificateHolt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011 but Trump continued to raise questions about its authenticity until 2015Nobody was pressing it nobody was caring much about it Trump said referencing the years between the release and Trumps decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America I figured youd ask the question tonight of course But nobody was caring much about it But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate and I think I did a good jobPaul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images7 Clinton Defends Being Prepared When Trump Questions Her Time Off the TrailTrump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said Ive been all over the place You decided to stay home and thats OK seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonights faceoffI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate Clinton said And yes I did And you know what else I prepared for I prepared to be president And I think thats a good thingThroughout the debate Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail That she doesnt stump as much as he does because she doesnt have his endurance8 Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of DiscussionTrumps support of stop and frisk a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department was discussed at length during the debateStop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City Tremendous beyond belief So when you say it has no impact it really did it had a very very big impact Trump saidTrump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional  which it was  and added instead that it went before a judge who was a very againstpolice judgeThey would have won an appeal he said noting that there was no appealTrump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate9 Trump and the Iraq War Under the MicroscopeToward the end of the debate Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it startedI did not support the war in Iraq Trump said That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream mediaHolt corrected him saying The record shows otherwiseThe only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion Stern asked Trump Are you for invading IraqTrump appeared to hesitate responding Yeah I guess so I wish the first time it was done correctlyDespite the attempt to correct him Trump continued to stress he was against the war saying The record shows that I am right10 Sparring Over StaminaHolt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a presidential look asking Trump what he meant by that Trump pivoted to attack her staminaShe doesnt have the look she doesnt have the stamina Trump said I said she doesnt have the stamina And I dont believe she does have the stamina To be president of this country you need tremendous staminaTrump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack downWell as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal a ceasefire a release of dissidents an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina Clinton saidShe also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about womenOne thing Lester he tried to switch from looks to stamina Clinton said But this is a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers Who has said women dont deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men","http://abcn.ws/2d56mMD","More Veronica,Ryan Struyk,More Ryan,Meghan Keneally,More Shushannah,Abc News,More

"9","Clinton vs Trump The debate before the debate","Hillary Clintons campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday nights big debate Dont let Donald Trump get away with itAnd Trumps campaign is firing right back arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and in any case Clintons team is just trying to game the refsStory Continued BelowThe debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battlegroundstate surveys Polling averages now show that Clintons postconvention lead has evaporated and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a dead heatThe latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only 1 nationally State firewall breaking up Trend lines awful Silver tweetedDuring the critical hours of expectationsetting ahead of the 9 pm showdown at Hofstra University both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard with Clintons aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt factcheck Trump in real timeWe are concerned that Donald Trump may lie he may throw misinformation out there and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CBS This Morning adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies that that simply be checkedThe thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves who have been selected by the commission because they will be seen as fair and evenhanded What bothers us Mark is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBCBut Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trumps claim that Holt may be unfair to him because hes a Democrat and the system is very unfair The NBC Nightly News anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003I dont know that he knew what Lester Holts voter registration was said Conway who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied He didnt lie Conway said at one point explaining that a lie would mean that he knew the mans party registrationIn a presidential cycle thats seen endless debates about debates Mondays theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator After suggesting a debate with no moderator Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldnt try to be Candy Crowley who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a factcheck of the GOP nomineeBut Clintons campaign has beat up on Holts NBC colleague Matt Lauer who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trumps false assertion that he didnt support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this monthView One week of Hillary Clinton factchecks September 24 2016 One week of Hillary Clinton factchecks September 24 2016The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates which selected the debate sites and moderators weighed in Sunday In our history the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said Janet Brown the commissions executive director told CNNs Reliable SourcesWhen it comes to factchecking Brown warned I dont think its a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia BritannicaFor her part Clinton wont let Trumps lies go by the wayside press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday insisting that Holt shouldnt eitherThere is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone by now should be able to call them out he said Lester Holt Hillary Clinton will too but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates performances should take it into account By now we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya he lies about who started birtherism he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now If he says them again that should be disqualifying He cant possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those liesFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign dismissed the idea that a factchecking moderator is of any concernI think what the concern is from both of the campaigns  and what it should be  is that the moderator is not the person whos running for president of the United States So I think you let the candidates debate you let the candidates answer he said You can hold people accountable theres no question but I dont think its the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so theyre making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debateTrumps campaign including his former aide Lewandowski also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camps preparation for two TrumpsWe dont want Donald Trumps lies and distortions to be a distraction Were hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do Mook told NBCs TodayAsked about Clintons rules of engagement versus Trump Mook added that it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate and we just dont know thatView One week of Donald Trump factchecks September 24 2016 One week of Donald Trump factchecks September 24 2016But Conway shot down the notion that theres any other Trump while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is to become human during the debate senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that Overprogramming leads to short circuits and Conway joined the pileonHes not going to be robotic and scripted Hillary Clinton is Conway said And thats a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that havent been preprogrammed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debatesAfter Mook warned against a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton you know is getting judged on the fine points of policy Conway added that the two campaign managers are living in parallel universesI mean Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs has been talking to the media for a week now saying its your job to make sure that Donald Trump is factchecked in realtime she said Im just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate But look they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clintons sweet spot Yes shes experienced at doing them but the experience hasnt necessarily been beneficialAside from how Holt will moderate Conway cited prewritten narratives and what she claimed was Clintons willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concernsIm worried that some of the headlines are already written that theyre conclusions in search of evidence Conway said adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debateWhat I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of quote objective reporters particularly our embeds These are not profiles in courage and this is not journalism There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter Conway said Ninetytwo percent of at least two of our embeds tweets are negative towards Donald Trump Why are they on our campaign plane Why are they covering our campaign  Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we cant get a fair shake from certain peopleConway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card skewing headlines that take away from the real estate moguls performanceSo if she ends up saying to him Thats just not true youre distorting my record youre being mean to a woman and then people will say He was mean to a woman and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up  even if its not true she said So that would be my concern that hes not able to get out all of his responses because as Joe Scarborough correctly points out people are so worried that shes not a great debater that shes not really ready for tonight the way he is that shes going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stageRudy Giuliani the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate said he had advised Trump to just let loose and be himself  and not try to compete with Clintons detailed policy expertiseShes been in government since I was a child I dont remember a time she hasnt been in government in one way or another Giuliani said on Fox and Friends So shes going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has but I think hes going to comport himself very very well and hes going to be  hes just going to be like you see him on  when he comes here on Fox News and when you talk to him on the phone Hes going to be Donald TrumpAuthors","http://politi.co/2d0l760","Jack Shafer,Steven Shepard,Glenn Thrush,Nolan D,Shane

"10","Is Hillary in a NoWin Situation","Ive watched every presidential debate ever broadcast including the littleremembered John F KennedyHubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary and for nearly 40 years Ive analyzed how candidates win and lose them But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump Im pretty much baffledThe problem is not just the unpredictable to put it mildly nature of her opponent Will Trump be lowkey and calm Will he attack her honesty Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clintons strengths in this strange election year can so easily be turned into her weaknessesespecially her vast experience in government The more she emphasizes her qualifications the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of Youve been at the center of power for 25 years Then youre one of those whos created the mess were in So reciting her work with foreign leaders for example and contrasting it with Trumps utter lack of grounding in the world doesnt seem to be promisingStory Continued BelowIndeed this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what Ive called political judoturning an opponents strength against her Yes Mrs Clinton your experience helped drag us into Iraq and turned Syria Libya the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS Maybe thats why your husbands CIA director and Bobby Kennedys chief speechwriter are backing meFurther theres a sensea highly limited sensein which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980 Among collegeeducated whites who have resisted him so far his task is to use the debates to say Im a reasonable person who knows whats gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it Its a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter but needed reassurance about Reagan which they got There is a limit to this analogy because for all of her difficulties Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter wasBy contrast how does she try to gain strength on the issue of honest and trustworthy If Trump can be convinced by his handlersassuming they existto avoid overkill here all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trumpbankruptcies Trump University David Farentholds expose of his charities in the Washington Postbut those issues are illsuited I think to a facetoface debate One of her problems longstanding is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trumpand hes still standingDoes any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night No It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and dont do based on a halfcentury or so of historyThe Focus Is on MomentsBut Theyre Not Always The KeyAsk any political journalist to recite the history of debates and it would go something like thisNixon looked pale and drawn Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control Reagan said to Carter there you go again then asked Americans are you better off Four years later he was incoherent but then recovered by joking about Mondales youth and inexperience Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wifes rape and murder Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy George HW Bush looked at his watch Al Gore stalked George W Bush who froze him with a nodThese are the moments that are played over and over again in the runup to debates They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip the gaffe the thrust the parry that can sum up 90 minutes Its why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy memorable lineszingersto win the attention and admiration of the audience Its also why the late political journalist Lars ErikNelson scornfully said of his colleagues Youve all become theater criticsBut in fact this view of debates is not the whole story Sometimes its the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails Look back at the first RomneyObama debate in 2012 There was no one exchange no one Obama stumble or Romney answer that provided the aha moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox It was rather Obamas petulant defensive sometimes indifferent answers that made even the presidents most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beatenThe presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a moment unlike any in debate history thats clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say he seemed pretty reasonable or she knows what shes talking about and he doesnt This has special relevance for Clinton who as her longtime friend and onetime aide Patti SolisDoyle observed always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth A sustained relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionableThere Are Three Debates Not OneAnd That Can Matter A Whole LotOne key reason why the 1980 ReaganCarter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two Carter had refused to debate with thirdparty candidate John Anderson so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st When the independent fell below the polling threshold Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28thbarely a week before the electionEvery other time there have been three debates which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut Thats what happened with Reagan in 1984 and with George W Bush in 2004 its also what happened last time out when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetingsHere I think is an opening for Clintonespecially in the town hall meetings where she should be able to turn a questionand they are usually very lame what can you do for my daughter questionsinto answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals and of Trumps astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore who challenged Bushs commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding What about DingellNorwood The opportunity for her is to arguefrom experiencethat what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better Further the Town Meeting formatwith dozens of real people as participantsmakes the resort to personal insults highly riskyTrump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political JudoThe potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo It came in 1992 when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experienceWell he said theyve got a point I dont have any experience in running up a 4 trillion debt I dont have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else I dont have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world the most violent crimeridden society in the industrialized worldJudo however can cut both ways Theres a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills and his business successWell you might be successful Donald but we really dont know because youre the first presidential candidate ever who wont show us his taxes But you know you should look at the business leaders who support me Mike Bloomberg whos worth four times what you claim to be worth and who didnt start with millions from his father says youre a con a fake So does Marc Cuban who built his success from the ground up But I do have to admityoure way way ahead of them in unpaid workers fleeced contractors and lawsuitsDebates Are NOT DecisiveOne last note Its easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night A lot of postelection narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story Reagan recovered from his first debategaffe and went onto win a landslide Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was reelected But is correlation really causation Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obamas clear if modest popular vote victoryIn their influential 2013 book The Gamble political scientists John H Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates gaffes and other gamechangers with realtime public opinion measurements What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romneys first debate performance had a relative small and relatively shortlived impact Compared to the fundamentalseconomic performance and the evergrowing impact of a polarized electoratethe stuff of which a hundred overwrought postdebate analyses are made may be of only marginal significanceOf course this cycle the fundamentals point to a very close race So youll probably want to tune in anywayJeff Greenfield is a fivetime Emmywinning network television analyst and author","http://politi.co/2d0FTlN","Jack Shafer,Jeff

"23","I Was RFKs Speechwriter Now Im Voting for Trump Heres Why","I was a Democrat all my life I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination I ran on a losing Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970 When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s thenGovernor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police CorpsThis year I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United StatesStory Continued BelowSo profound a change and a decent respect for old friendships requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decisionHere it is John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life But todays Democrats have become the Party of War a home for arms merchants mercenaries academic war planners lobbyists for every foreign intervention promoters of color revolutions failed generals exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments We have American military bases in 80 countries and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries Generals and admirals announce our national policies Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or actionNor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year Hillary Clinton sought peace Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions successive efforts at regime change She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as another Hitler She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades the neocons who led us to our present pass in Iraq in Afghanistan Syria Libya Yemen in Ukraine unrepentant of all past errors ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itselfIn fact in all the years of the socalled War on Terror only one potential American president has had the intelligence the vision the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once who sees that Americas natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attackingThat candidate is Donald Trump Throughout this campaign he has said that as president he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists On this ground alone he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors earlier in the primaries and now in the general electionIt must also be said Mr Trump is an imperfect candidate and he would surely be an imperfect president He is crude often vulgar He has areas of great ignorance He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words He is often intemperate though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putins moves in Ukraine to what Hitler didan insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War And it is not Mr Trump but Michael Morell a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate who has publicly suggested without rebuke from anyone that we should begin killing Russians a doubly illegal act of warMoreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually antiAmerican for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their onenote devotion to warJohn Kennedy admired political courage He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying Above all day and night with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess we must work for peace We must not have another war Years later in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders government officials and other public leaders to prevent a war with the Soviet Union there were 13 men in the ExComm room and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president the crisis would have exploded in nuclear warBut within a year thereafter deeply affected by the barelyaverted catastrophe President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev spoke all over the country to promote peace policies and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963 Our strategy of peace he said was not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war Rather it must be founded on negotiation cooperation in areas of mutual interest and recognition that our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet We all breathe the same air We all cherish our childrens future And we are all mortal As to our great adversary the Soviet Union he said we must reexamine our own attitudeas individuals and as a nationfor our attitude is as essential as theirsSix months later he was dead and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency Wherever he campaigned in 1968 to virtually every audience he spoke of the loss the horror the infinite tragedy of that war in words that could be and must be repeated today after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the worldOur brave young men he said are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia Which of them might have written a poem Which of them might have cured cancer Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university Which of them would have taught a child to read It is our responsibility to let these men live  It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their countryHe also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky sent by machines from a country she could barely understand He demanded of his colleagues on the Senate floor to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world to arrogate to ourselves the power of God the rule of life and death over others All this is our responsibility he said not just a nations responsibility but yours and mineJohn and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists nor ignorant of the realities of power But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint and with humility Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their deathThe legacy of JFK  RFK is being abandoned by todays Democratic PartyTheirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by todays Democratic Party We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins hundreds of thousands are dead millions are refugees and for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS Al Qaeda or Islamic terrorism generally our military leaders offer no prospects of victory They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean though they are quick to assure us as in Libya today that this conflict will go on indefinitely They cannot even explain how some of our current allies example Turkey are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies example the Kurds So a Democratic administration carrying on the work of the Bush presidency without thought and without question year after year has kept sending more young men and women into the grinderScores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world flaunting for all to see Americas unique military technology coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nationsMost amazing of all however is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe threaten the United States threaten Western civilization itselfas we face all this we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threatWhere are we sending our warriors our ships our planes Why to Russia which the US general who commands NATO has announced is the prime existential threat to America As you read this ground air and naval forces of NATO led and largely paid for by the United States have been moving about the Western borders of Russia carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II At the same time our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China our second said to be existential enemyThere are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999 The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought not to fight with Russia and China but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe todayFormer Defense Secretary William Perry a Democrat warns that we are now today on the threshold of a new Cold War  a new nuclear arms race  the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold WarSurely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire and our empire as every thoughtful person knows is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America by our governments our corporations our households our students and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future The years of constant combat have exhausted our military False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago Our forces are worn out especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decadeBut ominously there is more to come more that already stares us in the face The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history our inheritance to the latest dayFor the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings we were neglecting our own country and our own people our own neighbors our own children and our own friends And now we can see the result The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools The brilliant young men and women who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto They were not here to police the mean streets to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American livesAnd they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers This is our true present dangerSo my hope for America is this First we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless unnecessary and therefore murderous wars We need our best young people to help us here at home We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments We need to breathe free againWe must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated no quarter no hesitation But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations especially Russia and ChinaPresident Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security in this dangerous world would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people indeed at the end of his presidency Ronald Reagan said the same Fools in Washington intent on world domination would have us ignore that wisdom now But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our childrens futureSecond we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace There are many ills to be cured many shortcomings to be rightedBut nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police an insurrection against the Constitution itself Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments We need many more and better police We need them to be better trained not as warriors but as shepherds as leaders and teachers of the young as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years We need our very best young people not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan but saving all of our lives in St Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own landDonald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying America first But to demand that all the actions of government at home or abroad be first directed at the interests and wellbeing of our own country is not oldfashioned or outmoded Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens and a full commitment to those interests can we act wisely at home and in the world beyondFinally our president has told us we must lower our voices Of course we do not hope for domestic discord But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction from the heights of their power and eminence These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems and when we ask who will be the target for these worlddestroying weapons says only There can be no business as usual with RussiaSurely he must have misspoken for anyone can see we are on a course of madness We simply cannot fight the entire world Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast and fight a war at home all at the same timeAnd therefore we citizens must not be silent we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice a voice as powerful as Washington as Jefferson as Lincoln as Martin Luther KingReturn to the wisdom of the founders who fought necessary wars to defend the Union but sought no foreign conquestsDo not step over the threshold of a new Cold War a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilizationCommit to our own domestic peace and security rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nationsThis as I understand it is the platform of Donald Trump It was not the Republican Party platform and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination But it is his platform It is the platform he has restated again and again with determination and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics It is a platform that even in these troubled days could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all partiesWell may we seek reassurance whether Mr Trump has the kind of cool judgment and selfpossession that the presidency requires the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis that saves a nation or perhaps a world No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures But Trump has given some evidence He set himself a unique course toward the office disdaining conventional wisdom speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise And yet it is his independence his willingness to name facts however unpleasant together with his great political courage that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job Perhaps most important he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets to the immense loss of bothFlawed as he may be Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day Most important he offers a path away from constant war a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization Thus to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace life and death for our people and our country You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility in return for peace we may hope as Lincoln hoped among ourselves and with all nationsTruly America first last and always for ourselves and for our posterity These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for presidentAdam Walinsky worked in the Department of Justice during the Kennedy administration and later served as

"42","Obama Refugee crisis is test of our humanity","United Nations CNN President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis of epic proportions despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violenceThe Presidents interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world and pushing back against the antirefugee tenor was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders Summit on Refugees at the United Nations TuesdayAt the summit he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners  GOP presidential nominee Donald Trumps call to build a wall along the USMexico borderThis crisis is a test of our common humanity Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls or whether we see ourselves in another Obama said though he didnt mention Trump by nameObama singled out the situation in Syria which has displaced 48 million people so far as particularly unacceptableJUST WATCHED President Obama at the UN Then and now Replay More Videos  MUST WATCH President Obama at the UN Then and now 0145We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop he said describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries ability to take collective actionI called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time he said Just as failure to act in the past  for example by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany  is a stain on our collective conscience I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this momentThe refugee issue is one thats captured the worlds attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II seared into the publics consciousness by photos like that of a 3yearold Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into EuropeA recent study by from the UNs refugee agency estimated 653 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015 up by over five million from the prior year Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries but about 213 million are classified as refugeesObamas summit follows a similar UNled meeting on the issue Monday which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitmentsMake no mistake US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting additional efforts are urgently neededLeaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows  acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regionsYou have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thinThere will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants he addedThe Obama administration is hopeful the Leaders Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more actionNational Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering  cohosted along with the US by Canada Ethiopia Germany Jordan Mexico Sweden and the UN Secretary General  would seek an increase in funding of at least 30 a doubling of permanent resettlement and expanded access to education and work rights for refugeesReaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging yet the level of need demands no less Rice said in a statementBut aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately neededWe have to be optimistic that well see some real concrete commitments said Amnesty Internationals Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang But the truth is even if those numbers are hit its nowhere near whats actually neededThe US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees  particularly Syrias neighbors  and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85000 in 2016 to 110000 next yearThe Presidents chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action it is limited in what it can doThe Presidents commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effortVetting efforts to screen refugees he noted are not cheapDavid Miliband president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary said hes hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with actionThe scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response Miliband told CNN Governments around the world havent in the main been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to nowBut the cohosts of the Leaders Summit said in a statement they were pleased with new and significant humanitarian contributions from world leadersWe sought a 3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years they said Through our mutual efforts over the course of 2016 the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 45 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015As they await action from world leaders in New York a group of volunteers in London laid out a life jacket graveyard Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants whove lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the MediterraneanThe conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months but refugees are a global problemPerhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the socalled global south  the developing countries of the southern hemisphere Last week South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria Afghanistan and Somalia  countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroadAnd protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees  men and women in their twenties whove never known life outside of a campThese are not

his gunsights in 2009 and started ackacking it with regularityBut the he said/she said debate didnt move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One abovethefold piece by Michael Barbaro shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest birther declaration The Times piece elated critics of the he said/she said construct In an Atlantic piece titled The Death of He Said She Said Journalism Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaros work a journalistic sea change Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct Beinart stated and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what theyre actually doing is lying the Times piece dealt with Trump with astonishing bluntness Beinart wrote repeatedly calling Trumps birther nonsense a lie Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges which sits just fine with the he said/she said criticsStory Continued BelowWhile I consider Trump to be a firstrate liar and dont mind saying so Im not convinced that jettisoning the he said/she said blueprint is such a good idea Every politician lies If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump it would be entertaining But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances Isnt that what the factchecker columns are forIn his widely applauded critiques of he said/she said journalism Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the other side of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth the media creates a bogus symmetry between the he said voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the she said dissent Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out whos faking it more Rosen asked proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion The he said/she said structure constitutes one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence he would later remarkDonald Trump the thinking goes has gamed the he said/she said convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies obfuscations and doubletalk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue a clarification of something hes said or a response to a point raised by his opponent Hillary Clinton This is true In speeches and interviews hes expressed a broadband stream of lies such as denying that hes used terms like fat pig to describe women insisting that he never called George W Bush a liar claiming that he opposed the Iraq War making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule and more much more But they are lies all lies And every time the media quotes one of Trumps she said lies without a correcting factcheck it undermines the truth of the he said side of the debate At least so the thinking goesBut has journalists practice of giving Trump the right of reply allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster One result of the straight he said/she said coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll Thanks to this coverage many voters are able to see through Trumps posttruth style of politics and dont need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks Among his supporters many dont care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the tricksters campaign hes waging for the presidency Hes serving baloney and his supporters cant get enough of itAs bracing and as full of truthtelling as the Barbaro piece was I hope it doesnt embolden other news pages to abandon convention The formula when properly executed forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles The form is even more useful for skeptical show me readers who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue This I realize can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makersboth he said and she saidand like any good circus freak that makes him too exceptional to build rules fromOne reason I admire he said/she said journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the shesaid side of the equation and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry Whenever the shesaid component of a story goes missing leaving only the dominant position expressed I get the feeling Im being fed bunk Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views So why not news storiesI dont believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides or multiple sides hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any fieldruling paradigms if you dont mind the languagehave a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques In order for thought to progress the minority reporthowever seemingly misguidedmust be heardThe history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by shesaiders Early in the last century for example the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus to define yourself as a crackpot to be reduced to a shesaid if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story Today we think of the eugenicists as troglodytesOr consider the story of Alfred Wegener He 1912 he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect and his critics take his place as geologys crackpots Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment You think Its science its got to be accepted Marshall told Discover magazine But its not an absolute given By the mid1990s the idea finally took root undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery In 2005 Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work Science abounds with equally dramatic storiesObviously the critiques of every shesaider dont automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis The onesize fits all advice on mammograms has been abandoned Our views on saturated fat once almost holy writ have been chucked Until 1973 the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder All is not progress Some now argue that homophobia is an indicator of a disorder Marijuana makes you mad Today the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you Coffee once thought to be bad for you turns out to be good for you at least for now Moving over to the policy realm the once dominant superpredator thesis was once supported across partisan lines It is now discredited Remember how Japans economy was supposed to overtake the United States Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the US economic system was stable Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide And so onThe dissents of the shesaiders are generally beneficial Whether right or wrong the dissenters have a way of increasing everybodys knowledge If they are wrong as Michael Shermer has written their untruths force the dominant paradigm to selfexamine and if warranted use new evidence to improve its position If the shesaiders are right they advance human thought Thats how science works and I believe journalism should work that way too Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the kneejerk paradigmdefenders with this progression First Salk writes they say that it cant be true Second phase Well if its true its not very important Third phase Well weve known it all alongBefore anybody puts words in my mouth this is not my longwinded way of saying I dont subscribe to the global warming hypothesis I dobut at the same time I keep my options open The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers Even against crackpotsThe last and best reason for supporting he said/she said journalism So many readers and viewers have selfsegregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views These days many readers get only the he said side of the story or just the she said side remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on While I value partisan media I also value nonpartisan news operationslike POLITICOthat make ideas duel in their news pages NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars If you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts That is why the tone of journalism matters so much We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly and not to confirm our opinionsIf youre not getting a steady diet of she said quotations in your news consumption youre at risk of starving to death He said/she said keeps journalists honest even if on occasion it looks like its only accruing to the benefit of a beast

"62","Bridgegate Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee traffic jam as bad as possible","Newark CNN Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge as bad as possible according to testimony heard in federal court MondayDavid Wildstein former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects testified that in June 2013 Bridget Kelly Christies former deputy chief of staff was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey Mark Sokolich for Christies reelection campaignWildstein who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option according to his testimonyWildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal Sokolich testified last week that being a Democrat in a Democratic town put him in an uncomfortable position visavis a Christie endorsement and he eventually declined because he did not want to alienate anyoneOn August 13 2013 and as CNN has previously reported Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying Time for some traffic problems in Fort LeeGot it Wildstein respondedA phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward it was revealed in testimony MondayI did not question senior officials in the office of the governor Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decisionWildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his thenboss former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni according to his testimonyWildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baronis office and Baroni would not return the calls testimony revealedThis radio silence policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni Wildstein saidWildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to maximize the impact on Fort Lee Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and KellyBaroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9 Baroni smiled and said Fantastic according to Wildsteins testimony Kelly agreed on the September 9 dateWildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause sideswipe crashes Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanesOn Friday September 6 2013 Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday September 9Bob Durando Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a messWildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward and to prepare accordinglyI told him not to say anything to anybody Wildstein testified Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baronis officeWildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer Peter Zipf of the closures and asked Zipf to organize a way to get some numbers on the traffic patternsWildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton Port Authority director of Tunnels Bridges and Terminals Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye was aware Wildstein testified that he told Fulton yes but that this was a lieAll of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic studyOn the day the closures began Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington BridgeI knew the plan that I had set into motion was working Wildstein testifiedA Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the groundWildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up and she was pleasedSeveral calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials including the mayor Sokolich but their plan of radio silence was put into effect and no messages were returnedLast week Wildstein testified that Baronis role at the bistate agency was essentially to be a representative of Christies administration and that their top priority was to represent Christies offices interestsWildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used the one constituent rule This referred to the fact that Governor Christies opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs Wildstein and Baroni used the one constituent rule as a barometer by which decisions would be madeKelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own

the stage faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long IslandStory Continued BelowThats according to The POLITICO Caucus  a panel of activists strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states Roughly equal percentages of Democrats 69 percent and Republicans 74 percent said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issuesShe shouldnt be under more pressure but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself the press will give Trump a glowing review said a Nevada Democrat  who like all respondents completed the survey anonymously Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commanderinchief testThe media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump a New Hampshire Democrat added Presidents dont get graded on a curve and candidates in debates shouldnt be eitherOne Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female majorparty nomineeHillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard and this debate will be no exception said the Ohio Democrat She will have to answer every single question flawlessly exude gravitas look presidential channel Bills and Baracks oratorical mastery not raise her voice not cough wear an acceptable pantsuit smile enough be likable not laugh and have a good hair day Donald Trump will just have to show upRepublicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night but for different reasons tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground statesSomehow she needs to reverse the trend said an Ohio Republican Never seen anyone do it before This will be her chance  and maybe her last chanceShe has to stop Trumps momentum with a strong debate performance and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance added a Virginia Republican All Trump has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be presidentAmong those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure  31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans  most pointed to the GOP nominees volatile personalityHillary Clinton is expected to do well She is a policy wonk said a Michigan Republican The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool He has been doing very well in his public appearances but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer He will have no such help at the debate and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible To win the debate all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations keep his cool and look presidentialThe question we are all waiting to have answered is Can he be serious added a Michigan Democrat Can he answer questions directly How will he react or overreact when he is directly challenged Can he control his temperTwo other takeaways from the predebate surveyMost insiders expect Clinton to win the debateMajorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of RepublicansMedia look at who best answered questions and that will likely be Hillary said an Iowa RepublicanClintons mastery of issues and policies and nononsense delivery will prevail over bluster namecalling and promises that can never be kept added a New Hampshire DemocratBut not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton  or the media through which voters will interpret the debateThe press wants Trump to win said a Florida Democrat Their disdain for her plus desire to keep the race alive means unless he really screws up theyll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve everSome Republicans also claimed media bias  in the other directionThe media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history CNN NBC ABC and POLITICO will all say she won a Virginia Republican said But then again everyone also knew that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as wellInsiders think the debate will matterAsked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidatesAmong Democratic insiders 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent dont expect the debate to move the needleTrump will flounder ramble and lie because he always does a Michigan Democrat predicted The moderators will challenge him and hell get mad Hell complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary First impressions are hard to shake off and this wont go well for himThe numbers were flipped for Republicans with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standardbearer 52 percent think the debate will help Trump 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldnt have a significant impactTrump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and eventempered said a New Hampshire Republican He does that successfully and he cuts into Hillarys greatest strengthBut some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trumps momentum with a strong performance Monday nightIf she pins his ears back it helps her said an Iowa Republican If its a draw its a net negative for her She has to have something to stop his momentum Shes got to hit him with a brickOther insiders however doubted whether the debate would have a significant permanent effect on the raceWere past the era of the big debate swings the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer the Reagan age quip the Bentsen youre no John Kennedy moments an Iowa Republican said Swing voters are like the California Condor a critically endangered species

"72","Trumps puzzling pitch to black voters","CLEVELAND  Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically AfricanAmerican community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America Within hours Trump was proposing a vast expansion of stopandfrisk policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profilingIt was just another day in Trumps upanddown black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the DemocratsStory Continued BelowThe effort has taken Trump from a black church in innercity Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where on Tuesday evening he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyve ever been in before ever ever everOn Wednesday Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King  who dropped the Nword before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a gladiator King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have sufferedThe system is the problem and hes the only gladiator that will take on the system King saidAfter the church event Trump sat for a town hall with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity Asked by an audience member what he would do to address violence in the black community Trump embraced stopandfriskWe did it in New York it worked incredibly well Trump saidFierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and ultimately the mayors officeBut even before Trumps stopandfrisk comments he was taking heat for his ever ever ever remark Tuesday nightI dont know what Mr Trump is talking about to say that the situation for AfricanAmericans is worse than its ever been Rep John Lewis the Democratic civil rights icon said Wednesday on MSNBC Is he talking about worse than slavery Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination  when we couldnt take a seat at the lunch counter and be served Worse than being denied the right to register to vote to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communitiesTrumps polling numbers among AfricanAmerican voters have been dismal  in the low single digits  and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters particularly women and those in the suburbs that he is not racist Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks  What do you have to lose he says  to largely white audiencesAt the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowdSeated to Trumps right was Mike Pence his softspoken running mate To his left outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen Behind him King theres only one Trump said former presidential rival Ben Carson tough retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn a tough general and former Apprentice star Omarosa Manigault a wonderful woman who has helped with Trumps black outreachIm different from a lot of Republicans frankly Trump said from the pulpitTrump who has called himself the law and order candidate criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been choking in the fatal shooting Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidentsNow did she get scared Was she choking What happened But maybe people like that people that choke people that do that maybe they cant be doing what theyre doing OKKing whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conferenceKing clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States argued repeatedly that the system had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirelyEvery white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump said King who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of AfricanAmericansI told Michael Jackson I said if youre poor youre a poor Negro  I would use the Nword  but if you rich you are a rich Negro if you are intelligent intellectual youre an intellectual Negro if youre a dancing and sliding and gliding n I mean Negro King saidWhen Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later he grinned Ah theres only one Don KingBefore King Cohen Trumps attorney used his time at the church to slash at the disgusting liberal mainstream media and its casting of Trump as a racistThe word of the 2016 election has somehow become racist Cohen complained Ive lost count as to how many times the disgusting liberal mainstream media have attempted to label Mr Donald Trump as racist a xenophobe and a bigot And lets not forget sexist misogynist narcissist Islamophobe antiHispanic antiSemite demagogue And countless others Its disgracefulCohen said Not only is Donald Trump not a racist he believes that all people are part of one race the human raceTrump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters and that he wouldntThey come and they take your vote Trump said and they say theyll see you in four yearsAuthors","http://politi.co/2cRQmvU","Jack

"76","The Mystery of Trumps Man in Moscow Carter Page","In March in a bold Oh yeah moment during an interview with the Washington Posts editorial board Donald Trump took the papers dare and revealed then and there his very short list of foreign policy advisers There were just five though he said I have quite a few more The list was a headscratcher a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits One of the names offered without elaboration was Carter Page PhDWhoStory Continued BelowReporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector As for his connection to Trump when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trumps big reveal he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he will be advising Mr Trump on energy policy and RussiaThis piqued my interest I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life I spent years living and reporting from Moscow still go there regularly for reporting trips and am in touch with lots of friends there And yet despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter PageWhats this guys name says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia and would have overlapped there with PageI had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking Have you heard of this guyStrangely Ive never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection Bill Browder responded to me in an email He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic Its odd because Ive heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the timeSomeone apparently has heard of him On Friday Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by US intelligence for purported backchannel ties to Russian leaders The story resurfaced the name of a character whod all but vanished from the campaign and reawakened questions about who exactly Trump was surrounding himself withThis has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began a realestate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice Im going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign We want topoftheline professionals As the primaries unfolded it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the topoftheline help he could get when it came to foreign policy In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian AlQuds Force couldnt tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas and couldnt recognize the name of the leader of ISIS In his defense Trump said that Hugh was giving me name after name Arab name Arab name and there are few people anywhere anywhere that would have known those names The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to antiTrump manifestos And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate who were the people who would line up to advise him instead What would they be likeEnter Carter Page a 44yearold PhD and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy yet who I quickly discovered was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and theyll say Carter who You mean Jimmy Carter says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy Page also as I would be surprised to discover appears largely unknown to Trumps own campaignWhat I did find however is that while Page might not be helping Trump Trump has been a significant help to Page Since being named by Trump as an adviser Page who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union has finally begun to be noticed in the region He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America Hes an extremely wellinformed authoritative expert on Russia says Mikhail Leontiev a proKremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft Russias state oil giant People really respect him in this industry Hes a very serious guy and he has a good reputation According to the Yahoo report US intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officialsincluding Rosneft head Igor Sechinduring a summer trip to Moscow From what I could find about him its hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by TrumpPage has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press A March Bloomberg profile touted his deep ties with executives at Gazprom the stateowned Russian gas giant whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade Last month the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia some of them unsavory The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a wellconnected highrolling businessman with extensive business interests in Russia and an office around the corner from Trump TowerPage has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closeddoor meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington In July in Moscow he spoke at the New Economic Schools commencement ceremony a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago Page used the speech to slam the hypocrisy of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience saying Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization inequality corruption and regime change He is now frequently quoted on Russian television which hails him as a famous American economist and adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policyAll of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump when he shoots from the hip his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of insiders people who seem to be in Trumps orbit but who may not haveand may never have hadany access to the gilded inner sanctum at allBut someone is paying attention As I started looking into Page I began getting calls from two separate corporate investigators digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors the other wont say who turned him on to Pages scent Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov who was until recently Putins chief of staffboth of whom are on the sanctions listwhen Page was in Moscow in July for that speechSo the question continued to linger Who is Carter PageI should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldnt talk to me for this story I called his fund and left messages both on the general line and his personal voice mail I emailed him repeatedly I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him who passed the request on I even called Carter Pages father in Poughkeepsie New York who told me he would ask his son to talk to me But alas no diceThis was disappointing No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was and I just wanted to talk to someone who did At a certain point I just needed confirmation that he even existedOK I thought Try a different route Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didnt know Page but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy He did after all have such an impressive rsumPages biography on the website of his energy fund Global Energy Capital hits all the right notes It was at first glance the rsum of an upandcoming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group his bio reads He was involved in over 25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom RAO UES and othersThose were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s and Pages tenure in Merrill Lynchs Moscow office from 2004 to 2007 would have put him in the right place at the right time He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES a massive Russian electric power holding company He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project Those were huge huge things If he were deeply involved he would definitely count as a player And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those dealsSo I called Ian Craig the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009 who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through It wasnt really a deal to be clear Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake But Craig said he didnt know anyone named Carter Page He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynchs purported involvement in the deal I dont think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was frontlining the negotiations because it was all done at the highest level because it was very political says Craig  It closed at CEO level and eventually Putin himself signed off on itWhen I asked a prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite about Pages claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II he said I rolled my eyes at that one He too said he hadnt heard of Page until Trumps announcementFine OK Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES the Russian electricity giant Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter PageTurns out they didHis nickname was stranichkin from the Russian word stranichka or little page says Artem Torchinsky who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES Torchinsky who was part of the companys financial department worked alongside Page who at the time worked in Merrill Lynchs Moscow office It was 2007 and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers Torchinsky and the inhouse team did all the work and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation They were the fancy Western window dressing It really irritated our team Torchinsky told me over Skype We worked around the clock and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and wed have to correct them These guys didnt know what they were talking about As for Page He made no impression whatsoever Whether he was there or not it made no difference Torchinsky says When youre dealing with a pro you see it Page unfortunately did not leave that impressionOK harsh But then I talked to Pages former boss former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there He wasnt great and he wasnt terrible Aleksashenko says exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone without any special talents or accomplishments someone who was a gray spot What can you say about a person who in no way is exceptional he asked mePage was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs In the Moscow office there were five ranks and VP was right in the middle In effect it was just the oldest of the youngest three from the bottom says AleksashenkoWhen it came to finance Aleksashenko says Page was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments When it came to energy Page and his team were according to Torchinsky mildly speaking not competent in the field of energy And says Aleksashenko judging by the drivel he spews on Russia you can tell he doesnt really understand the topicTrumps putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy in other words did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or welleducated or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy says AleksashenkoFor the past few years Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert He has written columns in Global Policy Journal a new peerreviewed journal run out of Durham University They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps In recent months renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively he wrote Although commonly overlooked the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye Wests New Slaves and the artists creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of US foreign policy and world affairs but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary Slave Pronunciation /slv/ roping in Adam Sandler William F Buckley and Dick CheneyHis speech in Moscows New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition tautologies and abuses of the word ironically For the last 15 years Ive been researching teaching and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it he began The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place he couldnt really speak Russianhe had to have his questions translated for him into English Except to quote haltingly brokenly Vladimir Putin We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries Unlike the USA Which is troubling for two reasons that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in say Syria or UkrainePage also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations where he cut a strange figure Like other Westerners doing business in Russia Page took the view that Putin was not the bloodstained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it He had a guiltyseeming style in making these arguments making it seem like he didnt really want to engage one person from the Council says His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows That blog post about the slaves Thats just  strange says the Council memberHes a nice guy but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts he wouldnt be in the last decile but hed be in the secondtolast decile says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector Youd have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page I mean wowI shouldve just dropped the Carter Page story but in the months since Trump named him an adviser the campaigns Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue Fancy Bear who was probably a Russian hacker broke into the Democratic National Committee emails seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other Trumps second campaign manager Paul Manafort flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the proKremlin side of Ukraine and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode and it was all I could do to stay on Pages trail which began to look more and more like an infinity signI was not the only one Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Pages connections Then there was Page praising Putin I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives Was Page like Manafort followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election Was he a man who during a threeday trip to Moscow met with two of Russias most powerful men and was now being investigated for itBut it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade securing a spot at Merrill Lynchs London and Moscow offices Today he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion No one let him into Gazprom Aleksashenko says He didnt go shake Gazprom chief Alexey Millers hand He made sure there were cars hotels and meetings for investors in London Another of Pages colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Pages role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors something normally done by analysts the lowest rank on the totem pole People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time the former colleague said He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year I used to do this it doesnt require all that much skill You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 pm do you want to come The main thing is just getting those two Gazprom guys to agree But because they agreed doesnt mean theyre close to himBut the meetings did provide him with something else Gazprom didnt need money at the time says the former colleague They were the most profitable company at the time Their net profit was something like 36 billion a year Their problem was not getting investors but figuring out how to spend money in a nonefficient way if you read between the lines He was probably aware of that He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is Page became an investor in the company and has according to filings advised other companies hes worked for to invest in themAfter Merrill Lynch Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital But he tried to do this in 2008 and we know what happened to the markets in 2008 The fund is registered to his fathers address in Poughkeepsie Page listed himself as founder and managing partner even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko who was once a midlevel executive at Gazprom He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue addressthats the one around the corner from Trump Tower which was actually the address of a coworking spaceThats Carter Page says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia Thats what hes been doing without any actual funding without any actual experience without any actual connections or core capabilities hes been trying to throw together these deals Hes always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done I admire that it takes a lot of gumptionIn the interest of due diligence I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators that Russias Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russias invasion of UkraineI dont know this person said Pyotr Aven one of the two founders of Alfa Bank which is considered the Western Russian bank Aven and his partner Mikhail Fridman have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin As for who paid for Pages trip Aven was no less irritated by the question I give them money I dont know how they spend it who they invite when they invite them I have no idea he said of the New Economic School which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor Exasperated by my questions he snapped Dont bring these Russianstyle conspiracy theories to meYou are engaged in onanism said Leontiev the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin Its bullshit Just bullshit You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question Its hard to have a meeting with him at all Its absurdAs for the FBI investigation well its unclear A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that for one thing there is no prohibition meeting with a designated sanctioned individual Moreover sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI OFAC runs them He added the story doesnt add up What does seem to have happened is that various US intelligence agencies were looking into Pages time in Moscow then briefed Senate minority leader Democrat Harry Reid who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate among other things whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of US and European economic sanctions on Russia and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom met with highranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016 well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nomineeI got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller Trumps senior adviser I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off and asked him the tired old question Who is Carter PageWho says Miller and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaignHe has no formal role in the campaign Hope Hicks texted responding to my questionNow my interest was piqued There were whispers all over Washington that despite Hickss denial Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign but its conduit for Russian influence Was heOne way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin withOne source suggested to me that Richard Burt former US ambassador to Germany START treaty negotiator and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank was the nexus It was Burt who helped draft Trumps foreign policy speech in April and had been advising the Trump campaign via Senator Jeff Sessions on foreign policy But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop he looked at me and said he had never even met him The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post Burt told me And I told him Id never met the guy Let me put it this way if I have met him Ive forgotten Hes the former Merrill Lynch guy rightSomeone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn Sessions chief of staff who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trumps Alexandria Virginia policy shop and he happened to know Page But Dearborn wouldnt return my calls and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt but campaign cochair Sam Clovis who recruited Page If he was part of that original group of people I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis this person told meIm not answering your questions Clovis told me He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page but Jason Miller the campaigns other spokesperson says Carter Page isnt someone Ive interacted with Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me Carter is a red herring not a Rasputin Hes never met Trump never briefed him He has zero influence noneWas Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower or was he the nebbishy notverysuccessful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump saidhes my adviserand what his associates saidWho Maybe I wasnt doing this right and maybe everyone was lying to me but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that regardless of whatever game the Russians were running Page was firmly in the latter campI dont know about his Russia fund other than its never really materialized says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects Every conversation Ive had with Carter has not been terribly serious Theyve all been pieinthesky ideas There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities He went on I couldnt name a project that I could connect Carters name to any project that actually happenedI dont know how hes earned a living off this the energy player says but I think hes been trying to be an intermediary If you hang around Russia long enough its sort of like a pinball machine something will hit youStrangely it was not a Russian pinball that hit him it was Trump According to the Trump policy adviser this winter Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February March and said I want to be part of the team says the Trump adviser And thats how it happened Hes just a guy on a list Trump looked at the list and said Hes an adviser And now hes milking it for all its worthNow someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washingtonor at least could plausibly market himself as one I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign and even after that I had never heard of him one Russia specialist in Washington told me He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and what he saw was a strange kind of person one who was very differential to everyone there in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listenand be impressed He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow the Russia specialist recalls He didnt say what he was going to do there but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the tripAccording to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Pages trip to Russia the meetings did happen and thats been established as a fact I think the investigation is more what happened in them But it remained unclear the staffer told me unprompted what this even meant Its not just did he met with them or not but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on said the staffer Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against Americas national security interests Wittingly or un I should add Its whats hard to parse about this Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carr novel Or are they being played by much smarter people in the KremlinThis seems to be vintage Carter Page a man whose story never quite adds up as much as he tries to make the numbers work But hes also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful more connected even more evil than he really isand to try to turn a profit off of that If Page using his status as Trump advisor for personal gain thats another matter Time for Page to join Twitter Michael McFaul former US ambassador to Russia tweeted after news of the investigation broke The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page but Page must be loving every minute of it After all meeting Russias energy czar is an impossible dream for a wouldbe investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energybut the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March Carter Page PhD Now Carter Page PhD has found a perfect candidate to latch on to like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump sharkFor months now the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort and through them to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot and is there even a differenceThere doesnt seem to be one in the world of Trump which in some ways resembles Putins the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive And that is all that matters Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way or doing just enough to make us think he is and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American electionas we in the media continue to squeegee them around rarely really getting closer to the truth and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think weve finally grasped itJulia Ioffe is contributing writer at Politico Magazine","http://politi.co/2cYpJ8p","Jack Shafer,Julia

"78","Obamas team isnt laughing at Trump anymore","2016 Obamas team isnt laughing at Trump anymore The presidents aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringeObamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trumps hostile takeover of the GOP After eight years of Republican opposition inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president President Barack Obamas aides past and present thought Republicans had gotten what they deservedand more all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years agoTheyre not laughing anymoreStory Continued BelowGoing into Monday nights debate Obamas team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides maybe the country isnt what they thought maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress theyre so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe theyve always dismissed Maybe the presidents aides  current and former  now concede theyre going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against ObamaIm trying to think of a series to compare it to which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama said Ben LaBolt a former White House aide and press secretary for Obamas 2012 reelection campaign I feel like were maybe in the fifth season of Breaking Bad here Were way beyond the laughs and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terrorTheres not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him said another former senior Obama campaign stafferPrivately Obama has expressed mixed feelings according to people close to the president Hes still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump but its mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach People whove spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people whove benefited from his policieslike those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacaresupport DemocratsFor Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the presidents climbing approval numbers Trumps growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on hope Even if Clinton wins the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that theres an America that Obama never connected with at all and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly moneyWe are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008 and we are capable of that and more said Jim Papa a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House But were also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differencesTrumps already done things they never thought he could like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouetteAnd the result Trumps doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obamas team imagined With 43 days to go Trump and Clinton are essentially tied polls sitting within the margin of error even in battleground statesThough only a few weeks ago current and former Obama aides would joke about how the presidents great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him Now on the record they push back on the very suggestion that Obamas legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupiesI dont think he thinks its his legacy I dont think any of us think its his legacy said Dan Pfeiffer a former senior adviser to the president Trumpism is a lot of things in this country President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans but the Republican Party got themselves into this messBut they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obamas AmericaI think he will lose badly in this election but I think the impact hes had on our political process is incredibly damaging and will be lasting said Tommy Vietor a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago Hes made us look stupid I think he is stupidFor any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable as the president likes to say Trump has shattered that Vietor said He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can it doesnt matter if its a low blow it doesnt matter if its not of substance Thats a bad lesson for people to learnAccording to Earnest Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that hed had one to negotiate with on immigration reform trade infrastructure and other priorities The sense of lost opportunity eats at them as does the sense that its not going away despite their confidence in Clintons chancesIm not saying wed all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts said White House press secretary Josh Earnest whos been with the president since the first campaignNot everyones inside Obamaworld is down Some schadenfreude remainsHes still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates and will leave them with no infrastructure said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari SevuganAnd Democrats sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy thats gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much troubleThe eightyear legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement said Earnest is intellectually bankruptor about something other than the economyBut that doesnt take care of their grief about the state of American politicsId rather live in a world where the two parties really compete Papa said than have a political edge on the

"81","Is Donald Trump qualified to be president","Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president In the most pivotal moment of 2016 these are the questions he must answerHL Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician  downLikewise theres really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump  an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of oneliners faux familiarity and universal celebrityStory Continued BelowYeah yeah yeah its a big night for Hillary Clinton too Shes got a lot to prove for real namely that shes not the lying selfdealing crook many Americans think she is  or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who dont like her that her virtues temperament and experience compensate for decades of assorted ick She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump answer the usual email/foundation questions convince whoevers still sellable on the idea stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch millennials and listen up that shes not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearingin BibleBut the spotlight belongs on Trump who is in need of a rigorous job interview Clinton deserves the same but she is already the single most scrutinized parsed vetted investigated attacked and plaudited nonincumbent to ever seek the presidency Shes been around forever making enemies since the internet was dialup cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla MaplesEveryone makes the orange jokes but Trump is something of a black box  running on a few big and broad ideas curbing illegal immigration ditching bad trade deals restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness Hes bad with facts and the truth and perhaps worse takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesnt read books has the sketchiest sense of history doesnt read briefing materials and according to aides and ghostwriters cant even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefingThese are not nasty biased liberal opinions They are facts based on reporting and Trumps own public performances Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday  but taken together they add up to one big one Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States1 Does he actually know  or care to know  the basic information needed to competently run the countryOnly one verdict of presidential fitness counts of course and thats a candidates capacity to get to 270 electoral votes In recent days Trump  who swooned after Clintons superb convention in Philly  has closed to within the margin of error in many though not all national polls and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug 1 Hes still the most unpopular candidate in recent history although Clinton is number two with a bullet and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally But he can win Fivethirtyeightcom the archaggregator gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailingHis resurgence proves three political points  two of them we knew the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team The country especially the white workingclass parts is pissed Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and  lastly but not leastly  Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity developed late in the game to shift shape and shut up when he needs toThe first debate should be a pivot  from politicking to presidenting Being a cunning candidate isnt remotely the same thing as being ready to rule  and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial It probably wont happen but a boy can dreamThis is not to suggest that Trump cant do the job Ronald Reagan another entertainer who forayed into politics was mostly a success but hes been judged as a performer up to this point and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competenceTrump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs  apparently he wasnt aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently He obliterated Jeb Bush that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment in the debates  but Bush if anyone had cared to listen punctured Trumps bullyboy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression Trump wasnt aware of that fact or just didnt careThe caring part is kind of important if history is any guide In April I sat down with one of his longtime advisers Roger Stone who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme selfconfidence and supreme impatience All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not said Stone who has known the GOP nominee for decades When you write something for him keep it short and staccato Hes not going to read a 40page white paper on the economy zero chance of that Its just too boring Dont blame him I dont like it either So keep it simple and direct because thats the way he communicatesStone argued that Trump isnt an ignoramus  just a cuttothechase decisionmaker who is a lightningquick study But George W Bushs advisers speaking to biographer Peter Baker said that Bushs unwillingness to ask probing informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisisTrumps capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless  but theres not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the jobMany Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUDs Section 8 program is  and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screwthemedia base But dont people have the right to know what he actually knows Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms  by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate2 Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional governmentAgain this is not a given Hillary Clinton despises the press and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts Trump who banned news outlets including this one from his events for most of the campaign routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and in February went so far as to say Were going to open up those libel laws So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace  we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because theyre totally protectedThats a new one for a presidential nominee As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month For more than 50 years the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet they must show that the outlet acted with actual malice  that is with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or notDuring a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for Article 12 of the Constitution The framers stopped at seven He was just listing out numbers said Congressman Blake Farenthold RTexas a Trump backer at the time I think he was confusing Articles and AmendmentsOK lets write that one off as a gotcha  you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where some bad things are happening The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds3 Why wont Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debtsHillary Clinton has appropriately has come under intense scrutiny for her sixfigure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs  and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation the State Department and bigmoney foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruismBut the Clintons have released all of their tax returns in part because for many years they were required to do so as government employees and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single oneWhy does it matter Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his privatesector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House Senate and State Department At issue is Trumps fundamental personal narrative and his claim that hes very very rich He is but maybe not quite as much as he claims he says hes good for 11 billion Forbes and other outlets say hes worth less than half that muchMore serious is the issue of Trumps debts The Clinton campaign citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords If thats a lie theres an easy way to prove it  by releasing the returnsThis isnt a liberal media witchhunt Many Republicans including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan say he needs to cough them up and fast4 Whats the deal with his charitable foundation Then theres the matter of Trumps sloppily run and lessthanmagnanimous foundation In expos after expos Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of overpromising donations and the misuse of funds including a quartermillion payment to cover legal fees for Trumps businesses and sports memorabilia that Trump himself has conceded might be illegalThe problem yet again is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others5 Why lie These days the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound systemBut if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency he needs to be asked not only about individual statements hes made in the past but his pattern of lying stretching the truth and bungling factsHillary Clinton Crooked Hillary in Trumps parlance it bears repeating is no saint  far from it  and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading bordering on the untruthful and flatout lies in the view of GOP congressional investigatorsBut its a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness  especially George W Bushs claims about Iraq  would nominate the most brazenly truthchallenged candidate in recent history A recitation of Trumps whoppers would take up too much space  read POLITICOs comprehensive Donald Trumps Week of Misrepresentations Exaggerations and HalfTruths for a tasteIn an attempt to defend Trump buddy Newt Gingrich who lobbied to be Trumps running mate tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts Clinton the former speaker wrote is a fox who knows many things you can fact check Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thingBut getting the facts right  and telling the truth  is a big thing Its the only way citizens will ever look up to and not down on their leadersAuthors","http://politi.co/2dkiM5e","Jack Shafer,Kyle Cheney,Daniel Strauss,Daniel Lippman,Eli Stokols,Glenn Thrush,Brent

"83","Charity Clinton Foundation Distributed WateredDown AIDS Drugs to SubSaharan Africa  Eagle Rising","Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative CHAI distributed watereddown HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in subSaharan Africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News FoundationThe congressional report titledThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story was initiated by Rep Marsha Blackburn a Tennessee Republican and vicechair of the House Energy and Commerce CommitteeThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiativeThe congressional report focused on Clintons decadelong relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countriesIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the US government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm The company was vulnerable to US prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the US marketRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerceThe Department of Justice further levied a 500 million fine and forfeiture on the companyThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guiltyWhen companies sell adulterated drugs they undermine the integrity of the FDAs approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard ineffective or unsafe said Stuart F Delery acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice when the government announced its action against the Indian companyThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement alleged due to the companys diluted drugs it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality according to the reportThe question becomes how many people lost their lives how many people found it was a false promise asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNFThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaignBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first termThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial IndianAmericans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Securities and Exchange CommissionThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundations vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDAIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the watereddown drugsProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone the US Agency for International Development allocated 9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered more than 18 million packagesSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients perhaps even accelerating death from HIVrelated infections Roger Bate an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines told TheDCNFThakur told TheDCNF that many of the companys antiretroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patientsThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize he saidRanbaxys first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004 one year after CHAI began working with the firm The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa according to the reportThe FDA sent a public warning letter to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the companys quality control efforts It concluded that the drugs which included antiretroviral HIV/AIDs medications show much lower potencies in these batchesAlthough Ranbaxys generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the US CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the companys HIV/AID drugs to patients abroadBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai saying the drugs saved millions of livesNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with RanbaxyThakur said hes now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patientsThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials but was only met with silence I have tried to reach out to them he told TheDCNF But I havent had a great amount of success with the Clinton FoundationCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010 when it spun off into a separate entity The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff and they continue to operate in close coordination Bill Clinton for example is deeply involved with both organizationsCharles Ortel a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation claims their separation was deeply suspectIn the application trustees of the new entity including Bill Clinton falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts This is not true They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called CHAI was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation Ortel told TheDCNFThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive orderHe signed an executive order that relaxed intellectual property policy standards promising the US government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any SubSaharan country relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies the report statesCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic lowcost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers Ranbaxy Cipla of Mumbai India Matrix Labs of Hydrabad India Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg South AfricaCHAIs endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the US government under the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS relief  a 15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W BushThe flow of US funds combined with Clintons endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets according to the studyRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications three of which were approved by the FDA according to the congressional study Eventually the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugsThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years the report statesThe study also examined the key players in the ClintonCHAI orbit the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributionsOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation which Clinton cofounded with IndianAmerican businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trialVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined 9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill 33 million without board approvalBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the Clinton FoundationYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients To me its disturbing and very sad she saidThe

"90","Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton  Eagle Rising","I cant wait for Weekend at Chelseas to hit the big screen CNN and the rest of Hillary Clintons slobbering media sycophants have already written the script If this woman God forbid dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow these doting suckups  these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has understandably reached an alltime low  would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a minor setback to her inevitable victoryThe American people arent buying it This is a severely ill woman No more conspiracy theory dismissals Mrs Clintons mild cold er seasonal allergies I mean heat exhaustion that is to say minor case of pneumonia is evidently of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a mystery man who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable episodes or otherwise freezes up with a brain shortcircuit during a speechThis guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot also covered up and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizuresBlue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinsons disease  a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs Clinton likely suffers since when has pneumonia required a neurological squeeze testThe Clinton campaign needs to come clean They wont but they should I wonder what official diagnosis well get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though theyve been there a hundred times before Nothing to see here folks Secretary Clintons sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she powered through yesterday going doortodoorThe point is that once more by lying about illness Mrs Clinton has reinforced and justified concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president Shes proven yet again that she cant be trusted She has confirmed a number of preconceptions that voters as revealed by her historically low approval ratings have formed relative to her health and character Shes a liar Thats her default mode Shes corrupt And shes sick Very sick She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else  including the best interests of the nation and even her own lifeDo I take joy in Mrs Clintons sufferings and plummeting poll numbers Well no on the first yes on the second Do not gloat when your enemy falls when they stumble do not let your heart rejoice Proverbs 2417Indeed Mrs Clinton has had a very bad week but her poll numbers were already trending downward Her medical crisis over the weekend coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trumps supporters as a racist and irredeemable basket of deplorables has only served to accelerate the plungePerhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement  especially by this particular woman This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen Robert Byrd DWVa her friend and mentor Sen Byrd of course was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband former president Bill Clinton was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags  the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans not unlike those she just slandered worked hard to pass it Finally and going back a bit further this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the US while hundredsofthousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free themWhos the racistIm praying for Hillary Clinton Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie our eyes have been telling us the truth for months maybe even years now To watch this increasingly frail bitter and elderly woman stiffen up convulse and collapse into the arms of wellpracticed staffers is hard to stomach You cant help but feel some modicum of compassion for her wicked though she may beIts almost tragic to witness Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment Everything shes ever done or said and the mounding piles of lecherous BS shes put up with from her sexually predatory partnerincrime has been designed to place her in the Oval Office not as first lady but as president of the United States Proverbs 1921 says Many are the plans in a persons heart but it is the LORDs purpose that prevailsAm I saying theres no chance Hillary Clinton will win Not at all though I think it unlikely Between her devoted media harpies her team of aroundtheclock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and coverup theres always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victoryStill it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clintons political aspirations Even so I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector  a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her kneeWhen they visit her in prisonThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by

"96","Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISISThen This Video Shows Up","It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS He hadnt been sleeping well Michelle told him to take some deep breaths have some hot milk and rewatch Princess Bride but hed made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene and he was out of milk and Michelle had started snoring The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wetsounding like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat He had to get out of thereFirst he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch but it wasnt long enough for his legs and it smelled like generals butts For a long time he just wandered around the West Wing alone He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldnt He peeked into peoples desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns desks when suddenly a word appeared to him ISIS He grabbed a PostIt note and wrote it down What was it What did it meanIt wasnt until months later at Coachella that the idea started to take shape Obama loved electronic music  the beats the lights the DJs the wonderful fans  and every year for just one day the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival They would hang back and he would wear sunglasses a flower crown a neon tank top and a tight Europeanstyle bathing suit and just dance The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what theyd seen Hey bro its the president Yeah bro The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping sick beat He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word ISIS came back to him Ever since he was a little boy he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own Hed just never had the right idea People had been starting terrorist groups for years and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market he needed some big new shtick Wait Of course He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled PostIt note Yes He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization and it would be called ISIS Bonjour was naked now trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts He gave her his flower crown got in an Uber and drove straight back to Washington By the time he got home he had a planAt first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasnt kidding I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group hed tell them Theyd laugh and say something like Hey Mr President please dont ever say that again publicly Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America Then finally he decided the only person who could really help him was HillaryThey were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each others eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret Hillary laughed and said Is it about how youre really a terrorist He looked at her and said Yes actually She stopped eating her Popsicle Donald Trump was right about you He nodded About everythingHe explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919 and that he was 97 years old Hed made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags Honestly it took me like 20 minutes He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the insideIsnt that the plot of the first season of Homeland Hillary asked Obama nodded Kind of Also a little bit of The AmericansNo one had come close to guessing his secret until Donald Trump He didnt know what had given it away Hed been so careful Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog Bo Wait what Hillary asked She was starting to freak out Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bos eyes were really tiny LED screens Did you know that when Bo barks Obama said hes just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voiceHillary was quiet for a long time She had stopped eating her Popsicle and the whole thing had just melted away Now her fingers were stuck together and it looked like she had one weird fishhand When she finally spoke it was almost a whisper Youre a 97yearold Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America Obama nodded Hillary made a strange sound and cried out I feel like Im shortcircuiting Obama did his best to comfort her Bo does that sometimes Then hell go outside and poop out a printer cartridgeHillary was breathing hard She walked the length of the kitchen then walked the width of the kitchen and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raismans floor routine Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets but it was such a relief He felt light and loose He felt 87 again He took her hands into his Im sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fishhand Hillary apologized Do you mean a fin Obama asked They both chuckled with their mouths closed Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything Then he leaned down and said in a soft strong voice But I havent even told you the best part yet Im going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISISIsisNo ISIS All capsHillary and Obama talked for hours that night When they got tired of the kitchen they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a sixpack a joint and like a ton of cheese They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer When she felt sleepy she put her head just inside one of his arms closed her eyes and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night He said he didnt want to talk about that and told her in a cool way to stop smoking all the weed She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time but he was not as impressed as she thought hed be He told her like for real they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutesHe was starting to regret telling her about ISIS when suddenly she sat up looked him right in the eye and said Well wait until Im president and then we will secretly destroy America together Her words shot through him His heart was beating fast That was it That was the plan he had been waiting for and it was beautiful In the dim light he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been She looked scary like Jodie Foster in Nell A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair He couldnt stop smiling For the first time in his life he felt completely understood They put their heads back in the grass and he tried to remember the lyrics to Wonderwall as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair Pretty soon it was morning

"100","If You Cant Run Your Own House You Certainly Cant Run the White House  Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a RerunI am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind herThe year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson approved that message Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly war mongering opponent Barry GoldwaterToday as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnsons deceitful war policies Goldwaters vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nations mediaI mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made only this time that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure Such a rendering depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency would be shattering to her campaignObviously this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a Daisy remake aimed against Trump has been mentioned That being said such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffersSomehow if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned its message could outweigh Goldwaters 1964 deception when based upon the accuracy of recent eventsInstead todays voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as news and views With the recent aboutface announcement from Ted Cruz the medias reaction of ridicule was to be expectedNow another unbalanced AP report unfolded this one detailing Teds dramatic aboutface that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a pathological liar and utterly amoralAs the article relates Trump countered with his nickname of Lyin Ted insulted his wife and linked his father to the John F Kennedy assassination These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodderSchools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans So is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article even within the closing paragraph since many readers turn off after one paragraphAnother safeguard of a derogatory story which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is shortlived I say derogatory when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the liberal press moniker has now everyday acceptanceIt is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the publics reairing Also the blatant public disservice when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores needs no further explanationAlso with the first debate squarely in view the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas Especially annoying is the unchanged format and rsums of the personnel who will rule this forum In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusionThese quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objectionsWith that consider the Presidents past considerations of todays democrat candidate his hopeful successor when back during the 2008 primary Obama stated of Hillary She will say anything and change nothing Hillary cant be trusted and isnt qualified to be PresidentObviously the deception and the intentional abandonment along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur Not only is this pertinent its damning given the time frameAlso during that same campaign future first lady Michelle offered this opine If you cant run your own house you certainly cant run the White HouseApparently that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent it is omitted from an equal public reviewAgain wouldnt it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial only

"107","BREAKING WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up","The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clintons use of a private email server The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner who was caught sexting with a 15year old girl and who is the estranged husband of Clintons top aide Huma AbedinApparently Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained tens of thousands of emails from Abedin including emails she forwarded to herself from Hillarys email account which were not turned into the FBI What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary emails were likely just recovered by the FBI If any of the emails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation Lying to the FBI is illegal and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed This story is still developing but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11days before the election means they found something seriousOn July 5th 2016 FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clintons use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her Since then many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed dismay and disgust with Director Comeys decision Meanwhile many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBIA highranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision It was unanimous that we all wanted her Clintons security clearance yankedIt is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted the senior FBI official told Fox News We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out and then said but we are doing nothing which made no sense to usFox NewsUPDATE October 17 2016The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server The documents claim a State Department official pressured the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clintons emails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struckThe FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called The Shadow Government who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton and her staff as Secretary of State There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that placed Clinton her staff the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for her election campaignBBC

Clinton personally deleted many of the emails herself without oversightI know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and arent satisfied with answers to date While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing Ive either gotten discovery sanctions for fired people for etchttps//wikileaksorg/podestaemails/emailid/4099The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent and therefore did not commit a provable crimeHowever that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure email server to communicate with President Obama and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted emails personally She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the emails permanently and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself and her boss President ObamaThis suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the Presidents communications with her Meanwhile by protecting Hillary the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up By securing the White House for another 4years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33000 emailsWhen you consider these facts as well as the other revelations within the Podesta emails on Wikileaks it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign and the White House In effect the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy and hide the truth from the FBI Congress and the American peopleTimeline of EventsMarch 2 2015 The New York Times

Kahran Meyer who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene The 29yearold published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons

KahranAtLaw September 22 2016I didnt realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks when somebody said lets march to the police station It was peaceful people had signs that said Hands Up Dont Shoot Kahran Meyers told me at 150am tonightThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel At that time police were not at all directing traffic just keeping the peace Meyer told me almost breathlessly Ive been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up in protest and chant hands up dont shoot and there was a crowd of roughly 1000 people We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class the bourgeoisie that there is a problemAfter leaving The Epicenter police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square so the crowd was facing the hotel At that point all of the protests were completely peaceful  and thats when the riot police arrived I swear to god you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degreesMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied oh absolutelyFive minutes later a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the streetIt wasnt a gunshot she told us It was much louder It wasnt a civilian injury The way people scattered No way At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly They just shot him and people in the crowd were familiar with him the protester shot by police At that point the peaceful protesters who hadnt already left exitedAt that moment Meyers says that CharlotteMecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters As she made it to the next block police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protestersIt took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video it was a splitscreen According to Meyer that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer and when reunited said it was entirely too loud for a gunshot too It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipmentCNN reports Police say the

"134","Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony","113k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYDuring a Republican primary debate in September 2015 nowRepublican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because he wouldve gotten it if I wanted it But if that is true then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul  this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition which is perjury as Newsweek reportsOne of these stories is a liea detailed selfserving fabrication But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told this time the character trait that leads to Trumps mendacity is on full display He makes things up when he doesnt want to admit he lostAssume the story he told at the debate is the lie Even though Bushs story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallieshe had played the cash for outcomes political game for yearshe could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost Instead he looked America in the eye and lied And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida regardless of Bushs oppositionif Trump had wanted itThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates but not just any fact a fact which Jeb Bush wouldve full well known as would have Trump Because after Trumps nave attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an antigambling Republican governor failed he sued his former employee for his own failure Eichenwalds point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television and moderators let him get away with it unchecked orNow consider the other option that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony There he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadnt been tricked by Fields The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simpleTrump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and once again the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfectWhy is all of this important In the late 1990s House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater scandal for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could findRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies but unlike Trumps other tall tales and obvious gaslighting this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times or to national television and his partys base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on its headTrumps penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw but its a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for PresidentSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald theres no third option hereBush The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on somethingthat was generous and gave me moneywas Donald Trump He wanted casino gambling in Florida Trump interrupted Bush Trump I didnt Bush Yes you did Trump Totally false Bush You wanted it and you didnt get it because I was opposed to Trump I would have gotten it Bush Casino gambling before Trump I promise I would have gotten it Bush During and after Im not going to be bought by anybody Trump I promise if I wanted it I would have gotten it Bush No way Believe me Trump I know my people Bush Not even possible Trump I know my peopleTranscript of 2007 Trial DepositionA lawyer asked Trump Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment what approvals were needed and so forth Trump A little bit Lawyer What did you do Trump I actually spoke with GovernorElect Bush I had a big fundraiser for GovernorElect Bushand I think it was his most successful fundraiser the most successful that he had had up until that point that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue Lawyer When was that Trump Sometime prior to his election Lawyer You knew that Governor Bush Jeb Bush at that time was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida didnt you Trump I thought that he could be convinced otherwise Lawyer But you didnt change his mind about his antigaming stance did you Trump Well I never

PeopleThis is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative Anything with Clinton in it has to be corrupt but this resulted in the deaths of many many Africans They distributed watereddown HIV/AIDs drugs to patients virtually sentencing them to death An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this the question is did the Clintons know about it Im betting that they didRanbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce The DOJ also levied a 500 million fine and forfeiture against the company So one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of thisThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guiltyFrom The Daily CallerFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative CHAI distributed watereddown HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in subSaharan Africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation The congressional report titledThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story was initiated by Rep Marsha Blackburn a Tennessee Republican and vicechair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative  101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkinss book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life Gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clintons decadelong relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower permitting the US government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm The company was vulnerable to US prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the US market Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerceThe question becomes how many people lost their lives how many people found it was a false promise asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNFThis could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves Right when they need it least A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two IndianAmericans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundations aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the watereddown drugs But that it happened at all surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous All for moneyProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone the US Agency for International Development allocated 9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered more than 18 million packages Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients perhaps even accelerating death from HIVrelated infections Roger Bate an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines told the DCNFRanbaxys generic drugs are banned in the US but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide The Clinton Foundation and Clintons charity have not severed ties with them

"167","Postdebate Trump team hits moderator Holt for some hostile questions","He didnt ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about Donald Trump said about Lester Holt  Getty Postdebate Trump team hits moderator Holt for some hostile questionsDonald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandalsThey were leaving all of her little goodies out They didnt ask her about you know much Trump said on Fox Newss Fox and Friends But I was asked about my tax returns which Ive told about 500 times But you know I think I did  I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions I think I did really well in answering those questions but those questions are not answerable in a positive lightStory Continued BelowStill Trump was upbeat overall about the debate which he said went really well despite some hostile questions The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C for his performance as moderator praising him for his issuebased questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trumps real estate company in the 1970s even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuitI didnt think he did a bad job You know when you look at it you watch the last four questions he hit me on birther he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt He asked me about that Trump said Thats a beauty to be asked you know 40yearold lawsuit or older I just hate to say its older because then youll know then Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt will say Wow I didnt know Trump was that old Hey shell be unimpressedWell he didnt ask her about the emails at all He didnt ask her about her scandals He didnt ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed he said He didnt ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about I mean you know theres no question about it He didnt ask about her foundationAttacking Holt became a running theme from Trumps campaign Tuesday morning as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderatorI was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clintons candidacy  the FBI investigation pay to play the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya  that never came up GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning AmericaTrumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raisedI just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or emails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news she said You know one of our guests last night was Mark Geist not Mark Cuban Mark Geist whos a Benghazi hero and survivor And You know he was within several feet or yards of them and I think its a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issueWhile the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day had been tampered withI had a problem with a microphone that didnt work I dont know if you saw that in the room but my microphone was terrible I wonder was it set up that way on purpose he said My microphone in the room they couldnt hear me you know it was going on and off Which isnt exactly great I wonder if it was set up that way but it was terribleAsked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90minute backandforth Trump said she had not until the end of the debate when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado who Trump called Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping because of her Latin heritage Addressing Trump directly about the namecalling Clinton said Donald she has a name Her name is Alicia Machado And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this NovemberI know that person that person was a Miss Universe person and she was the worst we ever had The worst the absolute worst She was impossible and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe he said She was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem We had a real problem Not only that her attitude and we had a real problem with her so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl This was many years ago and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasnt quite that way but thats okay Hillary has to do what she has to doAuthors","http://politi.co/2dojlvi","Jack Shafer,Louis

"168","More Milestone Moments for Donald Trump  Eagle Rising","Last week I wrote an article titled Donald Trumps Amazing Week which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and Never Trumpers everywhere Guess what This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago Well no one is laughing anymoreThe latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly The latest Fox News Poll which was taken from September 1114 shows Donald Trump polling at 46 a onepoint lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45 The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 915 shows Trump at 47 with a sixpoint lead over Clinton at 41 The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 1214 shows Trump at 42 leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39 The CNN/ORC poll which was taken September 712 shows Trump with a 4point lead over Clinton in Florida Clinton still has about a 35 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states including Pennsylvania and Michigan but those gaps are getting narrower every day Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the toss up state categoryDonald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA just outside of Philadelphia Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump Trumps childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program Lower income families will also benefit from the plans offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC program up to 1200 per year Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts DCSAs to put money aside tax free for childcare Low income families will receive a 50 match of the first 1000 deposited per year generating up to an additional 500 per eligible family per year DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare after school enrichment programs and school choice Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parents expenses including in home nursing and longterm care Finally Trumps childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stayathome parents effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parents decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parentDonald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New Yorks most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance Trumps excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history Other than carrying an extra 1520 pounds Trump appears to be in excellent health Of course Trumps unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clintons health following her fainting at last weeks September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia Again only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event Well it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr Oz Show a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers During the one hour program the discussion of Trumps health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women So yes somehow all this concern about Hillary Clintons health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald TrumpTrump followed up the Dr Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon During the visit Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something unpresidential That is to say he told Fallon that he could mess up his hair While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely preplanned the fact that Trump said yes to the display speaks volumes He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken Furthermore The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions Once again Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the Trump Train Oh and one more thing by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his However small its another check mark in the honesty and transparency boxNow if all of this was not enough Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed two years early and under budget a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy he also seized the moment to put an end to the birther issue Trump took the microphone and said Not to mention her in the same breath as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy I finished it I finished it he said President Barack Obama was born in the United States period Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again Trump saidOnce again political correctness be damned Donald Trump has had another amazing weekThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of

"181","UNFIT Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today  Freedom Daily","978 SHARES Facebook TwitterI dont recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day Not only is Hillary Clintons health constantly making headline but its also commonly a part of Presidential polls The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health declineHere are the top takeaways from the pollMore than 40 of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either below average or very poor health according to the survey of 1501 people taken between September 12 and 13 Thats a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August when only 26 of respondents thought her health was subparThe share of voters who think Clintons health is average remained relatively flat at 28 in the new survey By contrast the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either above average or excellent health actually ticked upwards from late August from 33 to 36 just 22 believe the same of ClintonVoters are also keenly aware of the story with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clintons potential medical issuesWhile Hillary Clinton is only 68 yearsold shes one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade My mom is in her 60s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary at least Usually looking old or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems I cant see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillarys health The suspicion isnt from one particular thing its from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the pressAt one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other maladys It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinsons Alzheimers and Multiple Sclerosis Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting confused and needing naps of which she was probably severely punishedAnd then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out looking like she stumbled the coughing fits Recently another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone While this picture alone wouldnt mean anything there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some wayAnother of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairsThen there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someones armHeres an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet page after page It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out If you see the pictures of her rallies there are not many people I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter dont see her in person because she looks awfulAnd of course the coughing pictures America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US ever Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives shes gasping for air Its incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack  GASP excuse me President of the United States","http://freedomdaily.com/unfit-look-what-hillary-needed-to-get-up-the-stairs-at-her-rally-today/","","http://freedomdaily.com","fake",330,0.0363636363636364,0.109090909090909,0.145454545454545,0,0.00606060606060606,0.00606060606060606,-0.0393939393939394,0.0454545454545455,0.00606060606060606,0.0272727272727273,0.0303030303030303,0.0878787878787879,0.118181818181818
